# 💼 Transaction Dashboard - MERN Stack Coding Challenge

This is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to manage and visualize transaction data. It fetches product transaction data from a third-party API and provides analytics through tables, statistics, bar charts, and pie charts.
